🚀 **What Is Slope Game?**

At its core, Slope is an endless runner where you control a ball racing down a steep, neon-colored slope full of twists, turns, gaps, and obstacles. The ball moves forward automatically, and all you do is steer left or right. That’s it.

But don’t be fooled by the simplicity. As the game speeds up, your reaction time is pushed to the limit. Every second you survive feels like a small miracle.
